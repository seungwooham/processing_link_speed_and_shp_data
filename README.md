# preprocessing_link_shp_data
Preprocessing the Speed and Geographical Data based on SHP file

1. Why am I doing this?
- To visualize the link(road) speed of urban network, you need two kind of data.
 - Table that has raw data about link speed of urban network by time and link id
 - SHP file that contains the geometry of each link id
- But there is a problem
 - The link id in raw data about link speed and SHP file does not match
 - In speed data is given as "Service ID" of a link
 - SHP file
